We are Universal Transfer Learning (UTL) lab at Korea University with <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/donhk/">Prof. Donghyun Kim</a>. Our research pursuits are situated under the expansive umbrella of transfer learning, with a particular emphasis on investigating the transferability, generalization, and adaptability of robust artificial intelligence (AI) models across a wide array of AI domains and disciplines.

<h2 id="research-area">Research Interest</h2>
<p>Our overarching objective is to pioneer the creation of highly effective transfer learning algorithms that can seamlessly transcend the boundaries of disparate domains and modalities found within a multitude of fields. These algorithms will be specifically tailored to cater to a wide spectrum of real-world applications, thus driving innovation and advancements in various industries and sectors. </p>
<br />

<p>Our main research interests include but not limited to the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Domain Transfer (Domain Adaptation/Generalization) </li>
  <li>Task Transfer</li>
  <li>Pre-training for Transfer Learning</li>
  <li>Foundation Model Adaptation</li>
  <li>Efficient Adaptation</li>
  <li>Multimodal Representation Learning</li>
  <li>Transferable Representation Learning</li>
  <li>Un/self-supervised Learning</li>
  <li>Learning From Synthetic Data</li>
  <li>Learning Compositionality</li>
  <li>Etcâ€¦</li>
</ul>



**We are  looking for passionate new MS, MS/PhD, PhD students or Postdocs to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings) **!**
